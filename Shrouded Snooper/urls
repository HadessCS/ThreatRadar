EQL Rule
Here is an example of an EQL rule that you could use to detect network connections to the IP address 51.178.39.184:

sequence by host.name
  [network where destination.ip == "51.178.39.184"]


KQL Rule
Here is an example of a KQL (Kibana Query Language) rule to detect the same network connections:

destination.ip: "51.178.39.184"

EQL Rule
For EQL, you can create a rule to detect network connections to the specific URLs:

sequence by host.name
  [network where destination.address in ("51.178.39.184", "80", "443", "444") and 
   url.path in ("/Temporary_Listen_Addresses/", "/autodiscover/autodiscovers/", "/ews/exchange/", "/ews/exchanges/")]

KQL Rule
For KQL, you can use a similar query to detect network connections:

destination.address: ("51.178.39.184", "80", "443", "444") and 
url.path: ("/Temporary_Listen_Addresses/", "/autodiscover/autodiscovers/", "/ews/exchange/", "/ews/exchanges/")
